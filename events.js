        A minimum viable product (MVP) is a concept from Lean Startup that stresses the impact of learning in new product development.This validated learning comes in the form of whether your customers will actually purchase your product. DJ-Ecell had organized a webinar by Mr. Tanishq Ambegaokar on educating the students about creating a valid MVP. The following were the conclusions of the session.MVP is a validation for your idea. It gives you a sense if your idea is actually working or not. Study your product and research if there is a similar product in the market. Investors usually chase pace, conviction and execution power. After you have launched something small, try and find what people are liking about it and how you can develop a bigger product around it. Start networking and try reaching out to people in the industry on LinkedIn. Somewhere you will get a potential investor. Much of your learnings come through on-field experience. The event was a great success with students learning a lot about the topic.

        <b>Gaurav Jain</b>, Founding member of <b>XBillion Skillz Lab</b> is an ambitious leader with strong intent to solve the problem of unemployment in India. Being a former Railway Ministry official he was able to open our mind and make us understand how the system works. He being an intellectual gave us meaningful insight into his ecosystem of impact enterprises with the collective aim of to leverage technology, behavior sciences and practical modules to develop the ability to apply innate natural intelligence for situations, opportunities and challenges at the modern workplace.By making us understand with simplicity about artificial intelligence, and why his mission is important to ensure we do not get completely replaced by automation, he was able to make us view things in a completely different perspective other than our standard beliefs that our CV, our degree and CGPA determine the placements we get. He answered all the students' curious questions. The students seemed to have enjoyed learning about his inspiring journey, which to be honest most of us dream of.
        </br></br>
        On the other hand we had <b>Shronit Ladhani</b>, CEO of <b>CareerNinja</b>. So hard-working, yet at the age of 27 has visited 38 countries and plans on reaching his goal of a 50 soon maybe by the end of the year. He was able to win all our trust because he was a young role model no different from us in terms of normal graduation. We immediately started believing his ideologies and being inspired by him. We gained a lot of useful tips on how we can grow as an employee and gain maximum exposure. Everyone had smiles on their face at the end of this long, informative, but also exciting and delightful session of DJ Talks.

We had a list of thought-provoking ideas that they could choose from to learn through examples.Our prime focus was to give the students a remarkable opportunity to be registered at Atal Incubation Centre (AIC). Our speaker, Dr Indira Singh is associated with them and gave such wonderful insights into the unknown world of business models to us engineers. She discussed, with great interest, some of the most beautiful theories of business strategy- Blue Ocean and Red Ocean strategy. She taught us, from her wide intellectual and teaching experience, to identify and communicate the nine key elements of a business model:
        <br><br>
        Customer Segments, Value Proposition, Channels, Customer Relationships, Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partners, Revenue Streams, and Cost Structure
        <br><br>
        The case studies of Jio, Uber, Chumbak, AirBnB and Zomato, were discussed with great interest. The students seemed to have gained a lot of benefit from our <b>co-chairperson Vatsal Gupta's </b>introduction on entrepreneurship, even more from Pavan sir's basic introduction to segments related to business, but the most beneficial aspect was that they were introduced to a completely new subject that too by someone with more than 12years of corporate experience, and 12 years of teaching experience in the field.
